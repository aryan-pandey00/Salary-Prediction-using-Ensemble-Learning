# Salary-Prediction-using-Ensemble-Learning

This project predicts salaries using machine learning models based on job-related information.

#What It Does

- Loads and analyzes a dataset with job titles and salaries
- Prepares the data by encoding and scaling
- Trains 3 models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - XGBoost
- Compares the models using accuracy scores and error values

# Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

# How to Run

1. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook

3. Make sure the path to `Salary Data.csv` is correct

4. Run the notebook to train models and see results

# Output

- Graphs of job title frequency
- Model performance comparison
- Predicted salaries
